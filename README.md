### Example Website

---

This website was easy to make, it's mkdocs, with theme that has basically a
copy of the O.G. Deis branding, but with our Team Hephy logos applied to it!

The example kubeconfig can easily go out of date.

That's what Phase 2 is for...


#### Phase 2: Kubeconfig-ca-fetch

It is possible to regenerate this Kubeconfig file for yourself, with a bit of
Go code. Check out this related example: [kingdon-ci/kubeconfig-ca-fetch][]
