### Example Website

---

This repo is meant to be the easiest possible website, I ripped off Deis
branding to make this work as quickly as possible without looking completely 
horrid; it shouldn't look too horrid.

The second goal is to have an example kubeconfig

It does not need to generate an example kubeconfig until "Phase 2"

So, I will probably embed an example kubeconfig in some backticks in markdown.
